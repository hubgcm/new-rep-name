# old-rep-name

This is just a test to see the effect of changing repoository names under github.

1. Pushing commits the result to origin master worked even though that generated the following warning:
	- remote: This repository moved. Please use the new location:
	- remote:   https://github.com/hubgcm/new-rep-name.git
2. Pushing to https://github.com/hubgcm/new-rep-name master worked without warning.

Now for the fetch part ...

It worked except that there was a conflict between local and remote changes. Once I fixed the auto-merge result then I commited change and pushed to origin master again.
